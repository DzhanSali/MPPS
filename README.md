MPPS: Multipurpose Pyrhon Scripts

# Files and what they are for
iFuckedUpMyUSB.py - moves files ending with certain suffix to the trash bin. The story behind this file is that I created a duplicate of each of the songs in my USB flash drive by mistake but all of the duplicates ended with "-1.mp3" so I knew what I needed to delete and hence the python script for it.

MPPS: Multipurpose Pyrhon Scripts
This repo is going to contain plethora of Python scripts, each with different purpose, in hopes that I could be of ease and help to other people with similar problems to mine in the future. 

# Files and what they are for
iFuckedUpMyUSB.py - moves files ending with certain suffix to the trash bin. The story behind this file is that I created a duplicate of each of the songs in my USB flash drive by mistake but all of the duplicates ended with "-1.mp3" so I knew what I needed to delete and hence the python script for it.
